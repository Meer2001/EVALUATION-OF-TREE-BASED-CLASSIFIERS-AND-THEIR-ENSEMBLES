# EVALUATION-OF-TREE-BASED-CLASSIFIERS-AND-THEIR-ENSEMBLES
This project looks at tree-based classifiers and their ensemble methods. It uses synthetic CNF-generated datasets and the MNIST image dataset. The aim is to compare the performance of Decision Trees, Bagging with Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting across different data conditions.
